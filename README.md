## What is done so far
* Main screen where you can see all the events
* Taping on an event navigates the user to a screen where the events' corresponding pictures gallery is shown
* Event creation screen where the user is able to pick a name for the event, pic a place for the event by searching an address on the map and placing the pin on it and invite users to join the event.

## What has to be done in the future

* Enrich the picture gallery with more metadata
* add animations in the whole app
* add notification system
